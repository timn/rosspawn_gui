rosspawn_gui: GUI to instruct rosspawn
======================================

This ROS package provides a GUI application to instruct and monitor rosspawn.
It allows to start and stop nodes by the click of a button, and will
automatically update if the state of a node changes, e.g. if someone else
starts or stops a node.

This GUI is based on Fawkes' plugin GUI. See the rosspawn documentation of
some assumptions made and the limits of the current version. This is a proof
of concept implementation and probably not useful in its current state.
Comments and patches welcome.

Requirements
------------
The following software packages are needed on your system in order to
use actionlib_lua. Requirements marked with (*) have specific information
further down below.

- ROS 1.1			http://www.ros.org
- rosspawn			http://github.com/timn/rosspawn

Usage
-----
Run bin/rosspawn. Then run rosspawn_gui and click on any node name to get it
started or stopped. Usually no modifications are necessary to the nodes.
Nodes which are started without using rosspawn are currently not recognized.
On initial startup rosspawn_gui gets the list of available nodes. The list
is not currently updated at run-time.
